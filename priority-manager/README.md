# Priority Manager

**Prevent application crashes by ensuring critical applications always maintain the highest system priority.**

## Overview

Priority Manager is a lightweight, automated system that ensures your critical applications (like IDEs, trading platforms, or development tools) always have the highest CPU, I/O, and memory priority on Linux systems. It prevents crashes caused by resource contention and ensures smooth operation even under heavy system load.

## Features

- 🚀 **Automatic Priority Management** - Continuously monitors and maintains process priorities
- 💪 **Maximum CPU Priority** - Sets nice value to -20 (highest possible)
- ⚡ **Real-time I/O Scheduling** - Ensures disk operations are processed immediately
- 🛡️ **OOM Protection** - Protects critical apps from Out-Of-Memory killer
- 📉 **Deprioritization** - Lowers priority of competing applications
- 🔄 **Systemd Integration** - Auto-starts on login, runs continuously
- 📊 **Visual Dashboard** - Monitor priorities in real-time
- 🆘 **Emergency Boost** - Immediate priority adjustment when needed

## Use Cases

- **Development**: Keep your IDE responsive during builds and tests
- **Trading**: Ensure trading platforms never lag during critical moments
- **Content Creation**: Prioritize video editors, DAWs, or rendering software
- **Gaming**: Ensure game performance over background applications
- **Server Management**: Prioritize critical services over maintenance tasks

## System Requirements

- **OS**: Linux with systemd (tested on Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian)
- **Kernel**: Linux kernel with nice/ionice support (all modern kernels)
- **Tools**: `renice`, `ionice`, `systemd` (standard on most distributions)
- **Optional**: sudo access for negative nice values (highest priority)

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone or download this repository
cd priority-manager

# Run the installer
bash install.sh
```

### 2. Configure Your Applications

Edit `bin/priority-manager.sh` and customize the application lists:

```bash
# Applications to prioritize (highest priority)
CRITICAL_APPS=("your-ide" "your-app" "trading-platform")

# Applications to deprioritize (lowest priority)
DEPRIORITIZE_APPS=("browser" "email-client" "chat-app")
```

### 3. Enable Maximum Priority (Optional but Recommended)

For full priority control (nice -20), install the sudoers rule:

```bash
# Install sudoers configuration
sudo cp sudoers/priority-manager.conf /etc/sudoers.d/priority-manager
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/priority-manager

# Update the path in the file to match your username
sudo sed -i "s/USERNAME/$(whoami)/g" /etc/sudoers.d/priority-manager
```

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check service status
systemctl --user status priority-manager

# View dashboard
~/.local/bin/priority-dashboard.sh

# Check current priorities
~/.local/bin/priority-manager.sh status
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# View visual dashboard
~/.local/bin/priority-dashboard.sh

# Check current priorities
~/.local/bin/priority-manager.sh status

# Emergency priority boost
sudo ~/.local/bin/boost-now.sh

# Run once manually
~/.local/bin/priority-manager.sh oneshot
```

### Service Management

```bash
# Check service status
systemctl --user status priority-manager

# Start service
systemctl --user start priority-manager

# Stop service
systemctl --user stop priority-manager

# Restart service
systemctl --user restart priority-manager

# View logs
journalctl --user -u priority-manager -f
```

### Application Launchers

Launch your applications with pre-configured high priority:

```bash
# Example: Launch with priority
~/.local/bin/app-launcher.sh /path/to/your/application
```

## How It Works

### Priority Levels

The Priority Manager sets different priority levels for different application categories:

| Category | CPU (nice) | I/O Class | OOM Score | Description |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | -20 (MAX) | Real-time | -1000 | Highest priority, protected from OOM |
| **Normal** | 0 | Best-effort | 0 | Default system priority |
| **Deprioritized** | 19 (MIN) | Idle | 500 | Lowest priority, first to be killed |

### Monitoring Cycle

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Systemd Service Auto-Starts           │
└────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Priority Manager Runs                  │
│  Every 30 seconds:                      │
│  1. Find critical processes             │
│  2. Set maximum priority                │
│  3. Find competing processes            │
│  4. Lower their priority                │
│  5. Log all actions                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Protection Mechanisms

1. **CPU Priority (nice -20)**
   - Highest CPU scheduling priority
   - Gets CPU time before other user processes
   - Ensures responsive UI and fast processing

2. **I/O Priority (Real-time)**
   - Disk operations processed immediately
   - No waiting for other processes
   - Fast file access and saves

3. **OOM Protection (-1000)**
   - Protected from Out-Of-Memory killer
   - Won't be terminated if system runs low on memory
   - Other apps will be killed first

4. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Checks every 30 seconds (configurable)
   - Automatically reapplies priorities
   - Handles new child processes
   - Logs all actions

## Configuration

### Customizing Applications

Edit `bin/priority-manager.sh`:

```bash
# Applications to prioritize
CRITICAL_APPS=("app1" "app2" "app3")

# Applications to deprioritize
DEPRIORITIZE_APPS=("browser" "email" "chat")

# Check interval (seconds)
CHECK_INTERVAL=30

# Priority values
CRITICAL_NICE=-20          # Range: -20 to 19
CRITICAL_IONICE_CLASS=1    # 1=realtime, 2=best-effort, 3=idle
CRITICAL_OOM_SCORE=-1000   # Range: -1000 to 1000
```

### Adjusting Check Interval

To change how often priorities are checked:

```bash
# Edit the script
nano ~/.local/bin/priority-manager.sh

# Change this line:
CHECK_INTERVAL=30  # Change to desired seconds (e.g., 15, 60)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service Not Running

```bash
# Reload systemd
systemctl --user daemon-reload

# Restart service
systemctl --user restart priority-manager

# Check for errors
journalctl --user -u priority-manager -n 50
```

### Can't Set Negative Nice Values

Without sudo access, the script is limited to nice values >= 0. To enable full priority control:

```bash
# Install sudoers rule
sudo cp sudoers/priority-manager.conf /etc/sudoers.d/priority-manager
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/priority-manager

# Update username in the file
sudo sed -i "s/USERNAME/$(whoami)/g" /etc/sudoers.d/priority-manager
```

### Application Still Slow

1. Verify the application name matches the process name:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep your-app-name
   ```

2. Check if priorities are being set:
   ```bash
   ~/.local/bin/priority-manager.sh status
   ```

3. Run emergency boost:
   ```bash
   sudo ~/.local/bin/boost-now.sh
   ```

### High CPU Usage

The Priority Manager itself uses < 0.1% CPU. If you see high usage:

1. Check the interval isn't too aggressive
2. Reduce the number of monitored applications
3. Check logs for errors

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for more solutions.

## Performance Impact

- **CPU Usage**: < 0.1% (negligible)
- **Memory**: ~5-10 MB (minimal)
- **I/O**: Minimal (only reads /proc)
- **Check Interval**: 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Startup Time**: < 1 second
- **Effectiveness**: Maximum crash prevention

## Security Considerations

The sudoers configuration is safe because:
- Limited to specific scripts only (not full sudo access)
- No shell access granted
- No ability to modify system files
- Only allows priority management commands
- Can be removed anytime: `sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/priority-manager`

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Run the uninstall script
bash uninstall.sh

# Or manually:
systemctl --user stop priority-manager
systemctl --user disable priority-manager
rm -rf ~/.local/bin/priority-manager.sh
rm -rf ~/.local/bin/boost-now.sh
rm -rf ~/.local/bin/priority-dashboard.sh
rm -rf ~/.config/systemd/user/priority-manager.service
sudo rm -f /etc/sudoers.d/priority-manager
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Development Environment

Prioritize IDE and build tools:

```bash
CRITICAL_APPS=("code" "vscode" "idea" "pycharm" "docker" "node")
DEPRIORITIZE_APPS=("chrome" "firefox" "slack" "spotify")
```

### Example 2: Trading Platform

Prioritize trading software:

```bash
CRITICAL_APPS=("tradingview" "metatrader" "thinkorswim")
DEPRIORITIZE_APPS=("chrome" "firefox" "thunderbird")
```

### Example 3: Content Creation

Prioritize creative applications:

```bash
CRITICAL_APPS=("davinci-resolve" "blender" "obs" "kdenlive")
DEPRIORITIZE_APPS=("chrome" "firefox" "discord")
```
