sort file              # Sort lines
uniq file              # Remove duplicates
wc -l file             # Count lines

unzip archive.zip             # Extract zip
gzip file                     # Compress

### Disk Operations
```bash
fdisk -l         # List disks

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1   # Format filesystem
fsck /dev/sda1   # Check filesystem
```

### Quick Tips
```bash
# Redirect output
cmd > file       # Overwrite
cmd >> file      # Append
cmd 2>&1         # Stderr to stdout

# Pipes
cmd1 | cmd2      # Pipe output

# Command substitution
$(cmd)           # Execute and substitute
`cmd`            # Old syntax

# Background
cmd &            # Run in background
Ctrl+Z, bg       # Send to background

# History
history          # Show command history
!n               # Run command n
!!               # Run last command
