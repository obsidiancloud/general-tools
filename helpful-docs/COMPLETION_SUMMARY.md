## 📈 Optimization Decisions

### Combined Cheatsheets
To maximize value and reduce redundancy, some related tools were combined:

1. **PostgreSQL, Redis & MySQL** - Combined into single database cheatsheet
   - Reason: Common patterns across databases
   - Benefit: Side-by-side comparison

2. **GitLab CI & GitHub Actions** - Combined into single CI/CD cheatsheet
   - Reason: Similar YAML-based syntax
   - Benefit: Easy comparison between platforms

3. **jq & yq** - Combined into single data processing cheatsheet
   - Reason: Similar query syntax
   - Benefit: Unified JSON/YAML processing reference

4. **Helm & ArgoCD** - Combined into single Kubernetes tools cheatsheet
   - Reason: Often used together
   - Benefit: GitOps workflow integration

5. **Vim & Tmux** - Combined into single terminal tools cheatsheet
   - Reason: Complementary terminal tools
   - Benefit: Complete terminal workflow

6. **GCP & Azure** - Combined into single multi-cloud cheatsheet
   - Reason: Alternative cloud platforms
   - Benefit: Multi-cloud comparison
